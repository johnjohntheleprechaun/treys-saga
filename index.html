        <p>Just like so many of us, Trey had grown tired of the society he lived in, and he decided to give up. Leave society. He didn't care anymore.</p>
        <p>Soon after the original Trey comic was posted another artist, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kinan_Rod/>" target="_blank">u/Kinan_Rod</a>, created a spin-off comic called Tress, from the perspective of Trey's co-worker. Although there was some conflict about Kinan_Rod's use of davecontra's work, it has since been resolved, and these two comics sparked the creation of nearly 100 comics and 70 unique characters in the span of just 5 days. The Trey comics focus mainly on themes of suicide, life, and the connections we have with others (even if we don't realize it).</p>
        <p>All of these comics were being compiled by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fyxr/" target="_blank">u/fyxr</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/1avuap5/the_trey_saga/" target="_blank">this post</a>. Their dedication is greatly appreciated by everyone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comics" target="_blank">r/comics</a>. They also inspired the creation of this website, which has the main purpose of documenting the entire Trey universe. Comics, characters, timelines, and the relations between them all. If you'd like to contribute, please check out <a href="https://github.com/johnjohntheleprechaun/treys-saga" target="_blank">the github page</a>, and otherwise I hope you enjoy exploring the Trey-verse as much as I have.</p>
